## ✨ Overview

This project implements a **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** system specifically designed for loan-related queries. By combining the power of LangChain with vector databases, it provides accurate and context-aware responses to loan information requests.

🎯 **Perfect for:** Financial institutions, loan advisors, and anyone needing quick access to loan documentation and policies.

---

## 🚀 Features

✅ **Intelligent Query Processing** - Natural language understanding for loan-related questions

✅ **Document Retrieval** - Efficiently searches through loan documents and policies

✅ **Context-Aware Responses** - Provides accurate answers based on retrieved information

✅ **Vector Embeddings** - Uses state-of-the-art embeddings for semantic search

✅ **LangChain Integration** - Leverages LangChain's powerful chain capabilities

✅ **Scalable Architecture** - Designed to handle large document collections

## ⚙️ Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher 🐍
- pip package manager 📦
- Virtual environment (recommended) 🔒

### Steps

1️⃣ **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PriyanshuKanyal37/Loan-Rag_Langchain.git
cd Loan-Rag_Langchain
```

2️⃣ **Create a virtual environment**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3️⃣ **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4️⃣ **Set up environment variables**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys
```

---

## 💻 Usage

### Quick Start

```python
from src.rag_pipeline import LoanRAG

# Initialize the RAG system
rag = LoanRAG()

# Load documents
rag.load_documents("data/loan_docs/")

# Ask a question
question = "What are the eligibility criteria for a home loan?"
response = rag.query(question)

print(f"Answer: {response}")
```

### Running the Application

```bash
python main.py
```

### Example Queries

💬 "What is the interest rate for personal loans?"

💬 "How long does loan approval take?"

💬 "What documents are required for a business loan?"

💬 "What are the repayment options available?"

---

## 🔧 Configuration

Edit the `config/config.yaml` file to customize:

- 🔑 **API Keys** - OpenAI, HuggingFace, etc.
- 📊 **Model Selection** - Choose your preferred LLM
- 🗄️ **Vector Database** - Configure storage options
- 🔍 **Retrieval Parameters** - Adjust search parameters
- 📝 **Prompt Templates** - Customize response generation

---

## 📊 How It Works

```mermaid

    A[📄 User Query] --> B[🔍 Embedding Generation]
    B --> C[🗄️ Vector Search]
    C --> D[📚 Document Retrieval]
    D --> E[🤖 LLM Processing]
    E --> F[✅ Generated Response]
```

1. **Document Ingestion** 📥 - Load and process loan documents
2. **Embedding Creation** 🧮 - Convert text to vector representations
3. **Query Processing** 🔍 - Transform user questions into embeddings
4. **Similarity Search** 🎯 - Find relevant document chunks
5. **Response Generation** 💡 - Use LLM to synthesize answers
